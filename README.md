# crossfitbuddyWF
A windows forms program to generate excercise sets.
Made for my begginer programming course finals.
## Description
This is a very simple presentation of a mobile app project I was working on at the time.

As with most of projects that I have worked on for my course work, the names of variables, and comments in the code are made using polish.

    Download the project files and run the .sln file inside Visual Studio 2022.

        You need to to have the "Desktop development with C++" installed.
